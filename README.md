For my Second Project ( Launching an EC2 Instance as a web server using Terraform on AWS )

What is EC2?
AWS defines it as Elastic Compute Cloud.

It’s a virtual environment where “you rent” to have your environment created, without purchasing.

Amazon refers to these virtual machines as Instances.

Preconfigured templates can be used to launch instances. These templates are referred to as images. Amazon provides these images in the form of AMIs (Amazon Machine Images).

Allows you to install custom applications and services.
